# Cards

Flexible Task Management

## Requirements
* Visual Studio 2012
  * Extensions
      * xUnit Test Runner (for tests)
     * Web Essentials
* SQL Local DB
* Internet connection

## How to setup
* Open Cards.sln
* Build (nuget will automatically install required libraries)
* Run

## Tasks
Task will be managed within GitHub. Feel free to assign a task to you.

## Notes
I switched to CoffeeScript from JavaScript. This requires Web Essentials so that it will auto compile with the project. For those who still prefer JavaScript, you can still add them in the normal Scripts folder.
